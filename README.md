## Software Development Engineer
**ACT**
Rio de Janeiro, RJ, BR
09/2020 - 07/2021

- During my time at ACT working for Prudential Brazil, I was part of a team responsible for developing a new app that helped the company track the onboarding process for new sellers. Our goal was to make it easier for Prudential to identify any issues or bottlenecks in the process and make improvements to increase efficiency.
- To achieve this, we developed the app using the latest technologies, including .Net Core for the backend and Ionic with Angular 9 for the front end. Our team also integrated data from legacy systems and consulted multiple databases using message service with Kafka. We maintained a strict style guide for the components and implemented unit tests with a coverage of at least 80%. The client side of the app was developed in React using a modern structure, and we conducted all tests with Jest.
- The outcome of our efforts was a highly functional app that enabled sellers to track their progress in the onboarding process, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to increase their efficiency. The app was well-received by the company and contributed significantly to the success of Prudential Brazil's onboarding process, ultimately helping to increase sales and revenue.

- The outcome of my efforts was twofold: first, the company was able to increase its speed in developing new features, allowing them to remain a leader in their industry. Second, my contributions helped my team to overcome technical challenges and improve the overall quality of the software. I am
